Socket: WiFi IoT Socket (MDK-Middleware Network)
------------------------------------------------
This implementation uses an [IoT socket](https://mdk-packs.github.io/IoT_Socket/html/index.html) layer that connects to a 
[CMSIS-Driver WiFi](https://arm-software.github.io/CMSIS_5/Driver/html/index.html).

The IoT Socket is implemented using 
[MDK-Middleware Network](https://www.keil.com/pack/doc/mw/Network/html/index.html).

The file `socket_startup.c` configures the WiFi connection with these settings:
 - SSID:          network identifier
 - PASSWORD:      network password
 - SECURITY_TYPE: network security

Note: These settings need to be configured by the user!
